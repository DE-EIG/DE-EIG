HOW TO INTEGRATE DE-EIG INTO YOUR DE VARIANTS:

	Simply call Xover.run to complete the crossover. Please note that the 
	input parameter CR must be a NPx1 vector which contains the crossover 
	rate for each pair of target vector and donor vector.

TO THINK ABOUT THE BIG PICTURE OF DE-EIG:

	Please run this program by DEEIG.main.
